                    <h3 class="post-title">Ranking Movie Musicals</h3>
                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>So, I am a huge theatre kid I love musicals maybe it is because I always want to break out in song. So, I made
                            a YouTube video about this you can check it out by using the link down below, but I decided to write down in more detail on 
                            each musical but if you want a short summary about what I think you know where to click. This is going to be almost a critic 
                            and feedback on each movie I am also going to include my thoughts on my honorable mentions as I only said their names on my
                            video. Personally, I find it easier to write down my opinion or in this case type it down because I am still 
                            getting used to talking on a screen so freely. I left a bunch of musicals out of my video because even though some might say 
                            they are movie musicals I do not these are movies such as <strong><em>Bohemian Rhapsody </em></strong> which i consider more of 
                            a biography which had to add music numbers because the biography is about a musician. So, most of these movies are mainly musicals that 
                            were strictly in the musical genre of things.
                             
                                      </p>
                        <p>For my top ten favourite musicals the first is <strong><em>Teen Beach Movie</em></strong> which if you do not know is a Disney musical product
                        and no, it is not <strong><em>High School Musical </em></strong> in my a opinion it is even better maybe because I grew up more on <strong><em>Teen Beach 
                            Movie.</em></strong> The thing I feel about <em><strong>High School Musical</strong></em> is that because it was the O.G Disney teen musical so it wil always be in 
                            my heart but there is something about teen beach movie that I liked it was just a fresh air from all the musicals that tried to follow them like, no hate 
                            <em><strong>Camp Rock. </strong></em> But like most Disney original movies it felt like a bunch of plots put together like at first it waas good but when they did the 
                            whole mad scientist thing and the weather machine it really ruined the story as it just came out of nowhere and just frankly was not needed. 
                        </em></strong> Even though the acting and plot are cheesy this movie is nostalgic, the movie is about 2 teens who loves surfing but get warped into 
                        their favorite movie where bikers and surfers do not get along. Although Mack gets annoying from time to time. Honestly, it is not a horrible movie </p>
                        <p>
                            This movie was really good I mean Motown and Broadway put together but even though I love Beyonc√©  and I thought this was her best acting role I think
                             and most people will agree Jennifer stole the show I mean every time she was on screen you could feel her emotions. She deserved that academy award and should have been
                              the lead, Jennifer had that soul voice so did Jamie Foxx and Anika, but the movie was amazing the cinematography the plot was delivered well by all members of the cast.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Number eight is a constrovertial one for a lot of people but is the <strong><em>Greatest Showman</em></strong> I feel like I was watching the movie but not for the story but for the 
                            songs it was basically a 90 minute music video with random dialogue in between each song. I know musicals are about the songs but the story was meaningless, that movie was 
                            only saved by the actors who really used what they were giving to create an experience like no other. The music aside the story was rushed when I first watched it I did not even 
                            realize that the wife was jealous because it came out of knowhere one minute she is an irrelevant character next she is crying her heart out to <em><strong>'Tightrope.'</strong></em> And at the end he runs back to 
                            his wife on an elephant and she just lets hims back into her heart no questions. Aside from that on a positive note I loved the Zac Efron and Zendaya romance because I love my girl Zendaya all the way from <strong><em>Shake it up.</em></strong>


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A story of crime drama and romance <em><strong>West Side Story</strong></em> conbined woth the choreography and music give us a modern day depiction of <strong><em>Romeo and Juliet.</strong></em>
                             One of my favorite scenes is th use ballet to depict gang wars it is so artisticlly pleasing to watch. So if you are someone who is into strict action this is not for you as it is after all a musical
                             so what do you expect.

                              This movie tackles serious issues such as the discrimination (especially from the police who are basically useless in the whole movie) and inequality of immigrants. While the two's family fight against each other, the couple is trying their very best to stay together in
                              hopes of spending the rest of their lives together out of love. The ending is quite tragic; however, it is still a very good movie that I highly recommend to those who really want a memorable movie experience.
                             
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a feel good 
                            I used to like <em><strong>Mamma Mia</em></strong> when I was youmger but as I watched it again I am starting to realise even though all the actors were phenomenal the plot got lost in the middle of the movie the 
                                character of Sophie was a disaster I mean acting all innocent and confused does not  make you likable it  makes you look dumb and all of a sudden even though the wedding story that was cantered was useless it
                                 does not happen why because apparently you cannot travel the world if you are married. Then Donna gets married to a guy who lied to her years ago and only just met again like a week ago I mean really but if 
                                 you can see past the awful character personalities the odd and random plot points the song are good just because it is <em><strong>ABBA</em></strong> and I love them.
